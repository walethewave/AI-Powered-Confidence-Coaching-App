## üëã Why ConfidenceAI? (The Problem)

As a developer and mentor, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how self-doubt and lack of confidence can stall even the most talented people. Traditional self-help tools are generic, impersonal, and often fail to adapt to real, nuanced human struggles.  
**ConfidenceAI** was born from a simple question:  
> _What if everyone could access a supportive, expert coach‚Äîanytime, anywhere, tailored to their unique journey?_

---

## üöÄ Solution Overview

**ConfidenceAI** is a next-generation, AI-powered confidence coach built with Streamlit, Pydantic, and Google Gemini.
